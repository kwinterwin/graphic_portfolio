    <p><b>CorelDraw (styled CorelDRAW)</b> is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Corel Corporation.

    <p><b>Adobe Photoshop</b> is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows.
        Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, it has become the de facto industry standard in raster graphics
        editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a verb as in "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest",
        though Adobe discourages such use.[4] It can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing
        and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color and duotone. Photoshop has vast support for graphic file formats but
        also uses its own PSD and PSB file formats which support all the aforementioned features. In addition to raster graphics, it has limited
        abilities to edit or render text, vector graphics (especially through clipping path), 3D graphics and video. </p>
